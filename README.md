- Primary: `#667eea` (Blue)

- Accent: `#ffd700` (Gold)

### Styling
All styles are in `style.css` with clear sections for:

- Animations and transitions

### Functionality
The JavaScript is modular and well-documented. Key classes:
- `MusicPlayer` - Main player controller
- Event handlers for all interactions
- Utility functions for time formatting, etc.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Audio Won't Play
- Check if audio files are in supported formats
- Some browsers require user interaction before playing audio
- Ensure files aren't corrupted

### Visualizer Not Working
- The visualizer requires Web Audio API support
- Some browsers may block audio context creation
- Try refreshing the page if visualization stops

### Mobile Issues
- Ensure touch events are enabled
- Some mobile browsers have audio playback restrictions
- Try using headphones if audio is choppy

## 🔧 Development

### Adding New Features
The codebase is designed for easy extension:

1. **New Controls**: Add HTML elements and wire up event listeners
2. **Audio Effects**: Extend the Web Audio API integration
3. **Themes**: Add new CSS classes and color schemes
4. **File Formats**: Extend the file type checking in JavaScript

### Code Organization
- HTML: Semantic structure with clear class names
- CSS: BEM-style naming, responsive-first approach
